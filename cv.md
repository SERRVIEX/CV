## Profile
6 Experienced Unity developer in mobile game development for Android and iOS. Skilled in full-cycle development from concept to release, including technical implementation, UI/UX design, and balancing game mechanics. Adept at integrating Firebase, In-App Purchases (IAP), ads, and analytics to optimize gameplay experiences.

## Skills
### Development
 - Unity 2D & 3D (mostly)
 - C# programming, .NET
 - Shaders
 -- Simple shaders with HLSL
 -- More complex with Shader Graph
  - Assets integration
 - Firebase integration
 -- Analytics (default analytics without custom events)
 -- Firestore (saving user data)
 -- Storage (saving user resources)
 -- Remote Config (controlling some game/apps configs)
 -- Push Notifications
 -- Authentication (Google/Apple sign-in, email/password sign-in)
 - Mixpanel integration (custom events)
 - Advertisment integration (Admob, AppLovin, Unity Ads, Facebook Ads)
 - In-App Purchases
 - Git
 - Debugging
 
### Development Experience
- Patterns that I have used mostly (Command, State Machine, Abstract Factory, Strategy, Chain Of Responsibility)
- Experience developing standalone game tools
- Writing editor scripts
- Game mechanics, AI implementation, optimization
- Made a scripting language (deprecated), optimized scroll view, procedural voxel terrain, ui navigation system, sprite packer, local time anti cheat and much more.
- Experience with: Bundles, Animation System (mecanim), Cinemachine, DOTween
- Optimization
-- Memory: Texture atlases, low-poly meshes, dynamic resource loading
-- Graphics: Simple shaders, Level of Detail (LOD), occlusion culling, optimized shadows
-- Processor: Avoid frequent updates in large entities, use events and object pooling, multithreading with Task and Thread
- UI/UX Design
- Jira, Trello (planning process)

### Additional Skills
 Besides programming I also like to do sometime other things
 - Photoshop **(UI, Image processing)**
 - Adobe AE, Premier Pro **(video trailers, ads)**
 - Cinema 4D **(renders, video animations)**
 - PHP/MySQL **(backend)** - ``did in the past``
 - Lua scripting **(dynamic server code execution for unity)**
 - Objective-C, Java **(made some plugins for Unity)**
 - Google Docs, Sheets **(description, economy)**
